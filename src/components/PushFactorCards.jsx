    description:
      " In rural Pakistan, widespread poverty and limited access to stable employment are key drivers of labor migration. Many families survive on informal or subsistence labor, which offers little room for financial advancement. As one study notes, more than one in four rural households includes at least one male migrant who has left in search of better work opportunities (Mansuri 2006). This migration is not random. It reflects a systematic failure to provide viable livelihoods in local communities. Another report echoes this by stating that poverty, unemployment, and lack of decent work are the primary reasons Pakistani men head abroad (Arif and Amjad 2014). For many, especially those with minimal education or training, migration becomes the only realistic option to support their families.",

        caption:
          "Girls in Pakistan attending class outside with no desks or shelter from the heat.",
      },
    ],
    description:
      "Another major push factor is the limited access to quality education, particularly in rural regions. Many school-age children in Pakistan contribute to household income through labor, as formal education is either inaccessible or unaffordable. Mansuri (2006) explains how migration indirectly improves schooling outcomes for children left behind, particularly girls, by alleviating financial burdens through remittances. However, the initial lack of education among adults, who then become migrant workers, reveals a deeper problem. Without formal education or marketable skills, men have few job prospects at home, making roles like taxi driving abroad more attractive despite the physical demands and personal sacrifices involved.",
    quotes: [
      "‚ÄúII left school after 5th or 6th class because my father needed help in the shop. No one in my family ever went to college.‚Äù ‚Äî Bilal K.",
      "‚ÄúSchool was never really possible. I started working young and later got a license to drive buses. But even with experience, no education meant no chance at a better job back home.‚Äù ‚Äî Ali",
      "‚ÄúI finished matric and became a Hafiz. There weren‚Äôt many options beyond that for me.‚Äù ‚Äî Waleed",

        caption:
          "Protesters rally against inflation and IMF policies in Pakistan.",
      },
    ],
    description:
      "Economic shocks and environmental disasters also push men to migrate. For example, after the devastating 2010 floods, many Pakistani families lost their homes, crops, and sources of income. Arif and Amjad (2014) highlight how remittances served as a critical lifeline during this time, helping families rebuild. This reinforces the idea that in times of crisis, migration becomes a survival strategy. Combined with ongoing inflation, weak governance, and limited state support, these factors continue to make foreign labor markets, particularly in the Gulf, appear more stable and desirable in comparison.",
